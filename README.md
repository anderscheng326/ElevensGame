I created the class skeleton based on my UML diagram
I implemented the Deal() method which deals 9 cards to my hand 
Still working on logic/implementation of other mehtods


Readme Update 2.
Continued with the class skeleton
Implemented the following methods
PlayerMove(), SystemCheck(), Replace() and Reset()
Updated Rank.cs enum to add integers to the card rank
Still need to work on testing all methods together
Still have to implement CheckWin() method
